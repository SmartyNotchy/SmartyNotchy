## About Me
Hi, I'm Pilliam! I'm a high school student, and I'm really passionate about working with computers and creating whatever I can dream of with them. I have a lot of experience with working on projects in multiple languages and maintaining professional applications, and I'm excited to continue to work with computers and create projects that anyone can enjoy.

I also play Celeste a *slightly* unhealty amount. Current Any% PB is a 36:11.937, roughly Top 750 worldwide :)
