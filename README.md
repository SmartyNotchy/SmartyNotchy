## About Me
Hi, I'm Pilliam Wark (real name William Park, but shhhh). I'm a high school student, and I'm really passionate about working with computers and creating games and other projects with them. My dream job would be a game developer, but if that doesn't work out I'm comfortable with most programming-related jobs. I have decent experience with developing games and am proficient in multiple programming languages, and I'm excited to continue to work with computers and create projects that anyone can enjoy.

I also speedrun Celeste in my free time. Current PB is a 38:42.285, roughly Top 1000 worldwide :)
